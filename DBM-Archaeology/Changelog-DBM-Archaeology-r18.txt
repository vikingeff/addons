##Significant cpu optimizing (not that it was a cpu hog before but was certainly inefficient)
*No longer uses CLEU for anything
*Now uses RegisterUnitEvent instead of RegisterEvent since we only need player events for UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED
*Refactored some code to reduce redundancy
*No longer scans loot in instances since keystones can't be found there
